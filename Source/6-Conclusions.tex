\label{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS}

This paper presented the results of an empirical comparison of three psychometric instruments (i.e., 16PF, BFI, and CC) in SE. Our results showed a moderate correlation between 16PF and BFI, a weak correlation between (i) 16PF and CC, and (ii) BFI and CC. In terms of construct analysis (i.e., psychological perspective), our study reinforces the results of the Psychology field with regards to the correlation between 16PF and BFI, and we found a weak correlation between CC and BFI, opposing the findings from Yilmaz et al.~\cite{yilmaz2017examination}. Since this is an emerging field in SE, such contradicting results are expected in the scientific process. The analysis was performed in light of the instruments' psychological constructs and within the SE field, having relevance for both fields.

Regarding the implications for practice, having a better understanding of psychometric instruments might help hire and train software engineers and form software teams, but this analysis requires further studies. We expect that the present research contributes to having fewer contradictions between the psychometric test results in SE in the future. As future work, we plan to expand our study by comparing other psychometric instruments using different criteria or observing the application of psychometric instruments with more participants.

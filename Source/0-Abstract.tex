Over the years, researchers have explored the influence of human factors in software engineering, showing that the team members' personalities might affect teamwork. However, it is challenging to measure software engineers' personalities due to the number of available psychometric instruments and the possibility of using different scales and classifications. Our study compares the personality traits measured by three psychometric instruments used in Software Engineering: Big Five Inventory (BFI), 16 Personality Factors (16PF), and Context Cards (CC). For this purpose, we executed an empirical study in which we collected data from 29 software developers for each of the evaluated instruments. As a result, we identified a moderate correlation between BFI and 16PF, confirming the current state-of-the-art. For the remaining combinations, there was a weak correlation. As implications for this research, there is a need to empirically evaluate BFI and CC (context-specific survey) in terms of construct validity since they have moderate to low correlation.
